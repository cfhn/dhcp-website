                Abstract

                Die Heilbronner Chaos Party (DHCP) is an Event organized by Code for Heilbronn
                (CFHN) for decentralized, distributed, collaborative, hyperinflated Chaos and F.U.N..
                It is intended for people and non people of all kinds and species.
                A very important feature are community based contributions such as
                workshops and talks. 
                DHCP will be use by the World-Wide Chaos community for (at least) this year. 
                This specification defines the protocol referred to as "DHCP24", 
                and is an update to RFC 2068 [33].



                If you want to contribute to the chaos by adding a talk or workshop
                please follow the official RFC found <a href="http://example.com" title="wait thats the wrong one! Sorry I couldn't find the correct link :("> here</a>.
