                Abstract

                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
                protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
                systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
                many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
                distributed object management systems, through extension of its
                request methods, error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is
                the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
                to be built independently of the data being transferred.

                HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
                initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
                referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 [33].
