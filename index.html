                    DHCP24 an event organized by CFHN
                    for decentralized, distributed, collaborative, hyperinflated Chaos and F.U.N..
                    DHCP24 is designed to provide all sorts of added cultural value. It is intended to provide people with cognitive challenges through talks and workshops,
                    but also so called Capture The Flags (CTF).<br>
                    The first proposition of this event (DHCP24) with its simplest purpose, is being the handling of communication of, not only
                    limited to humans or human-like beings, but also not further defined intelligent beings. (something mit mate as main nutrition source).

                    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
                    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
                    document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].
                    
                    An attendee is not compliant if they fail to satisfy one or more
                    of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the event it
                    attends. An attendee that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED
                    level and all the SHOULD level requirements for its event is said
                    to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST
                    level requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements for its
                    event is said to be "conditionally compliant."
